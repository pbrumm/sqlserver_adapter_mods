SQLServerAdapterMods
====================

A collection of little fixes and modifications for the SQLServer Adapter for Rails 2.0 and above.

Specificly:

- Fixes schema dumper not dumping primary key when other than 'id'
- Allows dot notation for table name in create_table to indicate ownership (doesn't dump properly though)
- Removes custom adapter type casting for dates and times which is no longer needed and breaks on Windows
